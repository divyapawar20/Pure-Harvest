Pure Harvest - Organic Health Food Store
This is a frontend web application for an organic health food store, built to showcase a clean and modern design with basic user interactivity.

Project Description
Pure Harvest is designed to be a simple,  website for an organic food brand. The project focuses on a professional and appealing user interface to highlight fresh, organic produce. It includes a hero section, a product gallery with separate sections for vegetables and fruits, an "About Us" section, customer testimonials, and a contact form.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the core structure and content of the website.

CSS: The visual styling is handled with custom CSS and the Tailwind CSS framework for a utility-first approach.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity for features like the mobile menu, "Add to Cart" and "Wishlist" button confirmations, and toggling the customer stories section.

PHP & MySQL: (Backend files not included in this repository) A separate backend API and MySQL database were used for handling form submissions, demonstrating a full-stack architecture.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Product Gallery: Products are organized into distinct sections for easy browsing.

Interactive Elements: Buttons provide real-time feedback to the user without reloading the page.

Customer Stories: A dynamic section showcases testimonials from satisfied customers.

Upcoming Backend Session
The backend functionality, which includes the PHP API and MySQL database integration for form submissions, is part of a separate session. The code for the backend is not included in this repository.
